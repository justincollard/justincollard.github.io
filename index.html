        <h2 id="postOne">Why I Chose to Learn Web Coding</h2>
        <h6>Friday, June 26, 2020</h6>
        
        <p>Learning to code has alway been an interest of mine. It began when I first started to dabble in HTML when I was in the sixth grade. Back then we still had dial up internet, "dumb" phones, and the idea of watching how-to videos on YouTube was still several years away. So, I checked out the quientessential knowledge source for our time <em>HTML for Dummies</em>. As an eleven-year-old boy, I dedicated some basic time to it...but then lost interest to other things. Fast forward about twenty years and here I am again, looking at how to code because I needed something to do during quaratine. No better shut-in hobby than coding, right? Do I want to get a job as a web developer? No. At least not right now? Would it be nice to make some freelance money on the side? Yes. However, I would need to be <strong>very</strong> confident that I would be able to deliver what my client was requesting. So, for now, it will just be a hobby that I use to create random projects in the pursuit of gaining new knowledge and skills. I hope you stick around to see what my journey looks like. Maybe you can give me a few pointers. Maybe you can join me. No matter what, stay engaged in learning.

        <p>My personal journey to learning how to code begain with the most basic of knowledge. I figured, even if I wanted to get into app develoment later, that I should start with the mark-up languages in order to get a feel for what it is like to work in a command console. Now...don't get me wrong, I know that coding a website is <em>very</em> different than writing an app in Xcode...but I wanted to start somewhere. So for this post I am going to list the tools that I have felt are the most helpful and provide a breif context as to what role they have played in my personal web dev journey. Oh yeah, a key component to these things is that they are all <strong>FREE</strong>. I like free hobbies...you should to. Here we go:</p>
